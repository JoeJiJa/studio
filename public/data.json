    {
      "id": "case-1",
      "title": "An Unexpected Diagnosis",
      "scenario": "A 45-year-old woman presents with a 3-month history of fatigue, weight loss, and a persistent cough. She is a non-smoker with no significant past medical history. A chest X-ray reveals a solitary pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe.",
      "question": "What is the most appropriate next step in management?",
      "options": [
        "Initiate empiric antibiotic therapy",
        "Obtain a CT scan of the chest",
        "Perform a bronchoscopy with biopsy",
        "Reassure the patient and repeat X-ray in 6 months"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A CT scan is crucial for better characterization of the nodule (size, borders, calcification) and to guide further investigation, such as a biopsy, if warranted. While a biopsy may eventually be needed, CT is the standard next step."

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The clinical presentation is highly suggestive of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). While ANA is sensitive for SLE, Anti-dsDNA is highly specific and is part of the diagnostic criteria."
